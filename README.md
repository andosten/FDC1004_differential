# FDC1004_differential

This library provides functionality for differential measurement with the FDC1004 Capacitance to Digital Sensor.
Designed for use with the Capacitive-Based Liquid Level Sensing Sensor Reference Design from Texas Instruments found at http://www.ti.com/tool/tida-00317

## Requirements

 * Arduino
 * FDC1004
 
## Limitations
 * This library does not directly support single-ended measurement. Look for FDC1004-master created by Benjamin Shaya.
